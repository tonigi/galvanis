# galvanis: Physics-based twist on a Tetris-like game

Vibe-coded, so shitty.

You place falling bricks in a continuous universe with friction. 

Bricks are conductive. If a conductive path is formed between the left and right playground
boundaries,  current flows through it. Any blocks traversed get burned and disappear.
